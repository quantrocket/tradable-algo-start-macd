tradable-algo-start-macd
=========================

This is a Moving Average Convergence/Divergence algo. 
The code included in the project can be used to undertand how to write automatic trading strategies on tradable. 
You can use this example to see how strategies work on tradable and 
to write your own based on this code. To see this indicator in action, simply: 

 * Upload the Uberjar file to the platform
 * Go to the indicator section of the app-selector in the platform
 * Drag-and drop the indicator in a chart window. 

You will then see the indicator directly under the chart.

See the REAMDE included in the tradable project to see how to open the project in Eclipse.
