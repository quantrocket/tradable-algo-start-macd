tradable-algo-start-macd
=========================

This is a Moving Average Convergence/Divergence algo. 
The code included in the project can be used to undertand how to write automatic trading strategies on tradable. 
You can use this example to see how strategies work on tradable and 
to write your own based on this code. To see this strategy in action, simply: 

 * Upload the Uberjar file to the platform
 * Add the app to the workspace
 * Select an instrument on which to perform the strategy and press the play button. 

The strategy is now running and trade orders will be sent whenever it makes sense to the for the bot to do so according to its strategy.

See the REAMDE included in the tradable project to see how to open the project in Eclipse.
